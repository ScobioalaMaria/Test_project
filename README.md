# Test_project for Lab of Software Project Development 

## Description of the project
### Our original dataset was composed only by author names and titles of books. Then we decided to create a CSV file adding more books and columns with genres, year of publication, summary plot and number of pages.

## Goal of the project
### The goal of our project is to create functions where the user have the possibility: 
1. to write the name of the author and get all the books he/she wrote 
2. to write a specific title of book and get all the information about it
3. to have look for the bestseller
