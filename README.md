# Test project for Lab of Software Project Development 

## Description of the project
Our original dataset was composed only by author names and titles of books. Then we decided to create a CSV file adding more books and columns with genres, year of publication, summary plot, original language and number of pages.

## Goal of the project
The goal of our project is to create functions where the user have the possibility: 
1. to write the name of the author and get all the books of the specific author
2. to write a specific title of book and get all the information about it (author, year of publication, genre, original language, number of pages and summary plot).
3. to write the genre to see all the books related to it 
4. to add a new book in the dataset by entering its title
5. to add a new column in the dataset
6. to modify and/or insert new information in an existing space of the dataset
